You are given a string s. Your task is to count the number of ways of splitting s into three non-empty parts a, b and c (s = a + b + c) in such a way that a + b, b + c and c + a are all different strings.

NOTE: + refers to string concatenation.



**Example**

For s = "xzxzx", the output should be solution(s) = 5.

Consider all the ways to split s into three non-empty parts:

If a = "x", b = "z" and c = "xzx", then all a + b = "xz", b + c = "zxzx" and c + a = xzxx are different.
If a = "x", b = "zx" and c = "zx", then all a + b = "xzx", b + c = "zxzx" and c + a = zxx are different.
If a = "x", b = "zxz" and c = "x", then all a + b = "xzxz", b + c = "zxzx" and c + a = xx are different.
If a = "xz", b = "x" and c = "zx", then a + b = b + c = "xzx". Hence, this split is not counted.
If a = "xz", b = "xz" and c = "x", then all a + b = "xzxz", b + c = "xzx" and c + a = xxz are different.
If a = "xzx", b = "z" and c = "x", then all a + b = "xzxz", b + c = "zx" and c + a = xxzx are different.
Since there are five valid ways to split s, the answer is 5.

**Input/Output**

[input] string s

A string to split.

Guaranteed constraints:
3 ≤ s.length ≤ 100.

[output] integer

The number of ways to split the given string.

* **[input] array.integer sequence**



* **[output] integer**



**[JavaScript (ES6)] Syntax Tips**

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
